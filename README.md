Air Quality GNN model
README: Graph Neural Network (GNN) Model for Gauteng (South Africa) and Switzerland
Overview
This repository contains a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model designed to analyze and compare data from Gauteng, South Africa, and Switzerland. The model leverages graph-based approaches to extract insights from various datasets, focusing on social, economic, and geographical factors.
Contents
Data: Datasets used for training and evaluation.
Model: Implementation of the GNN architecture.
Training: Scripts and instructions for training the model.
Evaluation: Methods for evaluating model performance.
Results: Analysis and results of the GNN model.
